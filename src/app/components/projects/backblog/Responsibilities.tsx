          Given that we had an entire academic year to complete the project, we
          spent the first semester prototyping the interface and refining the
          user experience. The following semester was dedicated to building the
          final prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the lead UI/UX designer and developer, I was responsible for both
          designing these prototypes as well as implementing the front-end of
          both applications. I used Figma to design three prototypes of
          increasing complexity, gathering valuable feedback from user testing
          at each stage. The Figma mobile app provided an excellent simulation
          of a real app, enabling us to collect more insightful data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design phase proved to be quite challenging, as it required me to
          create a clean and intuitive interface that balanced the often
          conflicting needs of both developers and testers. This process
          frequently invovled revisiting our feature set and prioritizing the
          essentials to ensure we could deliver the minimum viable product on
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the design phase was complete, I began the development process. I
          built the front-end for both applications by writing reusable
          components for each page and integrating them with our API to display
          dynamic data.
